Housed within the Institute for the Quantitative Study of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity (QSIDE) since 2021, the DSPACE Group serves as the Instituteâ€™s research-intensive branch in the realm of police accountability. Our team of mathematicians, statisticians, and data scientists collaborates with community members and organizations to answer challenging questions about patterns in policing. Our endeavor is to make a direct and meaningful impact to the public and to contribute to scholarly research at the intersection of data science/statistics and policing.  \nLab Contributors\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClaire Kelling\n\n\nAssistant Professor of Statistics, Carleton College\n\n\n   \n\n\nAriana Mendible\n\n\nAssistant Professor of Mathematics and Data Science, Seattle University\n\n\n   \n\n\nAlex Wiedemann\n\n\nAssistant Professor of Mathematics and Computational Data Science, Hamline University\n\n\n   \n\n\nTim Marrinan\n\n\nData Scientist, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"
